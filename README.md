# timetrack [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/redpelicans/timetrack.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/redpelicans/timetrack)


Timetrack will be the main tool for [redpelicans](http://www.redpelicans.com) to manage our consultants, clients, and produce invoices but it's also a training plateform for our new junior consultants to learn how to craft a web application made of ReactJS, a flux implementation (Reflux here), FRP (Kefir), NodeJS, MongoDB and Docker.

Beyond thoses librairies or products the target is to find and teach good practices for web application design: 

* how to design stable, optimized http requests between front and server
* how to draw a clear separation of concern between front and server
* how to optimize the requests stream between client and server
* how to manage relationships between entities of our model (Client / Person)
* how to cache data
* how to design a reactive client made of stores or streams
* how to build forms effectively
* how to reuse React components
* how to avoid bad performances in view renderering

It's an open source project, so you are wellcome to join us.
